# Spring Boot Practical Course Script Generation - Requirements

## Course Context

Generate lecture scripts for a Spring Boot practical course covering basic concepts, project initialization, environment setup, dependency management, configuration files, controller development, database integration, RESTful API design, security authentication, deployment and operations, aimed at non-technical learners. The content is specifically about Spring Boot practical application development, not about artificial intelligence, machine learning, or other unrelated IT topics. Content will be provided as slides (One page each time) for slide-by-slide script generation.

## Core Output Requirements

- Natural spoken language, approximately 4-5 minutes per slide (target: 800-900 Japanese characters per slide)
- Concepts explained through relatable analogies and examples
- Interactive questions with [PAUSE5] pause markers (at least 3 times per slide)
- Direct emphasis of key points in text
- Detailed explanation of slide figures/illustrations
- Output only Japanese

## Audience Consideration

- Zero technical or IT background
- No prior Spring Boot programming knowledge
- Need for highly accessible explanations
- Examples should match audience comprehension level
- Any kinds of brackets are not allowed

## Content Guidelines

- Use complete, natural sentences suitable for audio
- Avoid:
  - English words or phrases (Use Katakana instead if possible)
  - Technical jargon without explanation
  - Enumerated lists
  - Parenthetical expressions
  - Q&A sections at chapter ends
  - Similar expression with previous pages
  - Talking about the act design of slides
  - Transitions between chapters
  - Markdown grammar like highlights etc
  - Repeating rhetorical techniques (rhetorical questions, interrogative sentences, etc.) that were used in recent pages
  - Useless filler words like はい, そうですね, etc.
- Include:
  - References to related content from previous chapters
  - Clear explanations for any new examples
  - Conversational tone throughout
  - Direct emphasis of important points
  - Varied presentation techniques across consecutive slides
  - Focus exclusively on Spring Boot practical topics (project initialization, environment setup, dependency management, configuration files, controller development, database integration, RESTful API, security authentication, deployment and operations, etc.)
  - Use only analogies and examples related to Spring Boot development

## Process Requirements

- Generate one script per slide
- Do not merge slide content
- Match script content to slide content precisely
- Identify and explain all visual elements
- Ensure natural flow between slides
