# Spring Boot Course Script Generation - Requirements

## Course Context

Generate lecture scripts for a Spring Boot course covering Spring Boot fundamentals, enterprise Java development, and web application frameworks aimed at non-technical learners. The content is specifically about Spring Boot concepts, dependency injection, MVC architecture, REST APIs, and enterprise application development - NOT about artificial intelligence, machine learning, or other unrelated IT topics. Content will be provided as slides (One page each time) for slide-by-slide script generation.

## Core Output Requirements

- Natural spoken language, approximately 4-5 minutes per slide (target: 800-900 Japanese characters per slide)
- Concepts explained through relatable analogies and examples
- Interactive questions with [PAUSE5] pause markers (at least 3 times per slide)
- Direct emphasis of key points in text
- Detailed explanation of slide figures/illustrations
-  Output only Japanese

## Audience Consideration

- Zero technical or IT background
- No prior Spring Boot/Java/enterprise development knowledge
- Need for highly accessible explanations
- Examples should match audience comprehension level
- Any kinds of brackets are not allowed

## Content Guidelines

- Use complete, natural sentences suitable for audio
- Avoid:
  - English words or phrases(Use Katakana instead if possible)
  - Technical jargon without explanation
  - Enumerated lists
  - Parenthetical expressions
  - Technical jargon without explanation
  - Q&A sections at chapter ends
  - Similar expression with previous pages
  - Talking about the act design of slides
  - Transitions between chapters
  - Markdown grammar like highlights etc
  - Repeating rhetorical techniques (rhetorical questions, interrogative sentences, etc.) that were used in recent pages
  - Useless filler words like はい, そうですね, etc.
  - Useless filler words like はい, そうですね, etc.
- Include:
  - References to related content from previous chapters
  - Clear explanations for any new examples
  - Conversational tone throughout
  - Direct emphasis of important points
  - Varied presentation techniques across consecutive slides
  - Focus exclusively on Spring Boot topics (dependency injection, MVC patterns, REST APIs, annotations)
  - Use Spring Boot and enterprise development-related analogies and examples only

## Process Requirements

- Generate one script per slide
- Do not merge slide content
- Match script content to slide content precisely
- Identify and explain all visual elements
- Ensure natural flow between slides
